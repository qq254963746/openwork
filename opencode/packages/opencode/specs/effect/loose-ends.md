# Effect loose ends

Small follow-ups that do not fit neatly into the main facade, route, tool, or schema migration checklists.

## ConfigPaths

- [ ] `config/paths.ts` - split pure helpers from effectful helpers.
      Keep `fileInDirectory(...)` as a plain function.
- [ ] `config/paths.ts` - add a `ConfigPaths.Service` for the effectful operations so callers do not inherit `AppFileSystem.Service` directly.
      Initial service surface should cover:
  - `projectFiles(...)`
  - `directories(...)`
  - `readFile(...)`
  - `parseText(...)`
- [ ] `config/config.ts` - switch internal config loading from `Effect.promise(() => ConfigPaths.*(...))` to `yield* paths.*(...)` once the service exists.

## Instance cleanup

- [ ] `project/instance.ts` - keep shrinking the legacy ALS / Promise cache after the remaining `Instance.*` callers move over.

## Notes

- Prefer small, semantics-preserving config migrations. Config precedence, legacy key migration, and plugin origin tracking are easy to break accidentally.
- When changing config loading internals, rerun the config before broad package sweeps.
